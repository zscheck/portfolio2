                <h3>MLB Tailgates</h3>

                <p class="port-desc">This app was originally a 72 hour hack-a-thon project built with React utilizing
                    both Yelp and Google Maps API's.  MLB Tailgates allows users to select which baseball stadium they
                    wish to visit, then it will return the top 10 sports bars according to Yelp which are located within
                    2000 meters of the stadium, with a visual of where they are located relative to the stadium on Google Maps.
                    In order to complete the application, I created my own API for stadium information and created a proxy
                    server to act as middleware for custom routes.  Future updates to this application will include custom
                    searches of activites beyond sports bars and converting the app to Redux.

                    developed as a one week group project.  As a customer on the website, you can browse through different

                    review your order and checkout.  As a restaurant owner, you can add and update restaurants to Delicious

                    using MongoDB with Loopback.  Future updates will include swipe payment integration, an order history
                    for customers to reorder past orders and an owners ability to set a max item quantity per order.

                    Loopback with Redux and ejs on the front end.  Users can sign up and log in locally or by using Github and Google
                    OAUTH.  There are three differed types of user roles, consisting of job candidates, employers, and admins.  Candidates
                    can search job listings for web developers by city. The job listings are generated by APIs from Zip Recruiter and Authentic
                    Jobs, as well as jobs created locally from employers.  A cache system in place for queries by city name, where a recently made
                    query will pull from our database.  Once jobs are displayed, candidates can filter listing by job type, as well as favorite 
                    jobs and mark them as applied.  Jobs marked as applied will hit an endpoint at JobTrack and seemlessly update their data with
                    one click.  Emplyers can post job listings to directly to our database, as well as edit those listings.  Admins have access to
                    all parts of our application, including blocking users and approving candidates.  They can also see the activity of every user.

                <p class="port-desc">Hangman is an application that was originally delveloped in two days and is built with Redux.
                    This app utilizes a random word generator from a package of over 1900 words and Wordnik API to generate synonyms
                    hints. All API get requests are cached using Redis Cloud for efficiency.  The three difficuly levels represent
                    how many strikes the user is allowed before he or she loses. My decision to use Redux was because I plan to expand
                    on this project in the coming weeks by creating a database using mongoose through mLab MongoDB where a users can log
                    in, see their running point total, display a leaderboard, and check out their completion stats by difficuly level.
                    Proceed with caution... THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTING!
